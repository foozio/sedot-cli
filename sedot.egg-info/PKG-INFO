# sedot

`sedot` is a lightweight command-line video scrapper that downloads videos from public Instagram posts, reels, and Threads posts. Supply one or more URLs and sedot grabs the underlying video stream and saves it locally.

## Features

- Accepts either Instagram or Threads URLs.
- Extracts video metadata via the public OpenGraph tags embedded in the post page.
- Streams downloads with a simple progress bar.
- Offers `--dry-run` and `--show-metadata` helpers.

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install .
```

This installs a `sedot` executable in your environment.

## Usage

```bash
sedot https://www.instagram.com/p/POST_ID/
```

Download multiple URLs at once:

```bash
sedot https://www.instagram.com/reel/AAAA/ https://www.threads.net/@user/post/BBBB
```

More options:

```bash
sedot --output media --overwrite https://www.instagram.com/p/POST_ID/
sedot --dry-run --show-metadata https://www.threads.net/@user/post/CCCC
```

## Notes & Limitations

- Only public posts are supported; private or restricted posts require authentication, which sedot purposefully avoids.
- Instagram frequently adjusts its markup. When metadata cannot be extracted, rerun later or open an issue with the failing URL.
- Threads video delivery currently relies on the embedded OpenGraph metadata; if Meta changes this strategy, the scraper will need to be updated.
